Nice product. Recommended

From a known brand and meet expectations.
This product is small and well protected by the SS covering.
"I am ok with 57.7 gb i recieved, one thing i found strange is that, You can't find the serial no. or even the product name on hp website. But i used a software and registered it under Hp v282W USB  category. 1.5 gb file took 5 and a half minutes to be copied from laptop to pendrive, Which makes it look slow since its 2.0 , rest all are fine"
"Nearly 10mbps read and write 4mbps good pendrive,but heating a lot"
Durability is also good because it's a metallic pendrive.Comfort easy to carry.After use so long time hours and  hours it will be some heat but it's negligible.

"Good Quality metal Pendrive, with storage capacity showing around 57GB. The pendrive is more durable than a plastic body pendrive due to its strong metal body.  Data transfer speed is around 7 to 10 Mbps in general, sometimes showing up to 20 Mbps it also depends upon the PC speed. Overall is good."
Transfers the files a bit slowly but gets the job done.
"Good pendrive for this budget, but the problem is the transfer speed is quite slow so its sometimes not convenient to use !!"
It was a good pendrive. Support in Mac and windows

"This product is compatible with my laptop, no connection issue, transfer of file is good 25 mbps, since it's metallic no issue with durability, fine with it's service. It's worth to buy as product especially Laptop with dell,hp,lenevo, etc. It's cost is also low on Amazon that's interesting for buyers as It's in demand and discounted price üòäüòä. I suggest all who are interested to buy pendrive go for it."
Youv'e said that it's of 128 gb but it's just 117 gb there's a difference of 9 gb
Well it's super slow in terms of read and write speed so think before buying

This Pendrive has good speed and also provides and minimum storage of 57.7 GB data space. If anyone wants a low budget then I prefer to buy this pendrive. If you have a high budget then you go higher or the latest version.

¬†Its a must buy under budget product. Loved its shape and size. Perfectly working. Using it over 4-5 months. One think is to keep in mind is please store or keep it away from iron things aur don‚Äôt store it in any iron container. I kept mine in small iron pocket size containers. Its taking the rust from it . Keep it away from moisture."
guys can go for it. its original product.
It's having only 117 GB which is supposed to be 128
.

Also you can copy-paste 25-28 gb file to check it was fake or real  if there was some problem in copying file more then 5 gb then 1.format your pendrive  2. Now choose:-capacity-28.9 , file system-NTFS , Allocation unit size -Default Allocation size. then start  now your problem was resolved ."
Better go for 3.0
Ease of installation and stability was good
It's data speed is too slow. If for you speed doesn't matter then you can go for it.
"It a very nice and sturdy material with wonderful shape, but providing only 1yr of warranty and many companies like Kingston and SanDisk provides 5yrs of warranty. But you should go if you like it"
Order 128 GB pendrive But Received 117 GB pendrive
